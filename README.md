Never wrestle with messy, lengthy SVG codes again! This project puts the power in your hands without the hassle. Simply select your desired SVG icon, and voil√†! No more copying and pasting long, tangled codes. Let us handle the heavy lifting while you enjoy clean, efficient rendering right from page load. It's the antidote to cluttered code chaos!

## Installation

1. Download the project files.
2. Extract the files to your server directory.
3. import the JS and CSS files on the pages using the link and script tags

```html

// css
<link rel="stylesheet" href="css/style.css">

// JS
<script src="js/svg.js"></script>

```

## Usage

Once the files has been linked you can proceed to make use of the icons like:

```html

<i svg="home" svg-width="25px" svg-class="svg-dark"></i>

<i svg="archive" svg-width="25px" svg-class="svg-dark"></i>

<i svg="calendar-edit" svg-width="25px" svg-class="svg-white" ></i>

```
**svg=""** should contain the name of the icon you want to use

**svg-width=""** should contain the with you want to set your icon at

**svg-class=""** should contains all class names you want to apply to the svg
